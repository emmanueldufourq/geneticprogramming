# Things related to genetic programming. Mainly for teaching purposes.

This repository will illustrate how to develop a genetic programming algorithm in Java in order to solve simple problems. Details will be provided for each step of the algorithm in order to render this a useful teaching aid for anyone wanting to implement a genetic programming algorithm. 

<b>The Building branch will be used until the algorithm is complete. The master branch will thus have no content. </b>
