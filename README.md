# geneticprogramming
Things related to genetic programming, mainly for teaching purposes.

This repository will illustrate how to develop a genetic programming algorithm in Java in order to solve simple problems. Details will be provided for each step of the algorithm in order to render this a useful teaching aid for anyone wanting to implement a genetic programming algorithm. The Building branch will be used until the algorithm is complete.
